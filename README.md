FYP Supervisor Finder – Firebase Integrated Web App

This application streamlines coordination between students, faculty, and administrators in the Final Year Project (FYP) process.

Users must first sign up or log in using their email (e.g., example@gmail.com) to access personalized dashboards based on their role: Student, Faculty, or Admin.

Students can view all available faculty supervisors filtered by domain or availability, and submit a single group project proposal by selecting a supervisor. They can track the status of their submission—whether it’s pending, accepted, rejected, or needs revision.

Faculty members have the ability to manage their profile, update availability, and review project ideas submitted to them. They can respond to submissions by accepting, rejecting, or requesting revisions.

Admins have full control over the system. They manage faculty members, view and update project ideas, and visualize key metrics such as supervisor availability and idea status using interactive charts.

For account creation or deletion, users can return to the login page and choose “Sign Up” or “Delete Account” as needed.
